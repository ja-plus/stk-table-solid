# Cell Merging

Specify cells to be merged through the `StkTableColumns['mergeCells']` function.

```ts
function mergeCells(data: { 
    row: any,
    col: StkTableColumn<any>,
    rowIndex: number,
    colIndex: number
}): {
    /** 列合并数量 */
    colspan:number, 
    /** 行合并数量 */
    rowspan:number
}
```
Return `{ colspan: number, rowspan: number }` to indicate the number of cells to merge, `colspan` for columns and `rowspan` for rows.

## Column Merging

### Column Merging in Virtual List <Badge type="tip" text="^1.1.0" />

::: tip
In horizontal virtual list mode, when the anchor column of a merged cell (colspan) scrolls out of the viewport, the visible column range is automatically expanded so that the merged cell is fully rendered.
:::

## Row Merging
<demo solid="basic/merge-cells/MergeCellsRow.tsx" github="https://github.com/ja-plus/stk-table-solid/tree/master/docs-demo/basic/merge-cells/MergeCellsRow.tsx"></demo>

::: tip
If the table data changes, the `mergeCells` function will be called again to recalculate.

### Row Merging in Virtual List
#### Simple Merging
<demo solid="basic/merge-cells/MergeCellsRowVirtual/index.tsx" github="https://github.com/ja-plus/stk-table-solid/tree/master/docs-demo/basic/merge-cells/MergeCellsRowVirtual/index.tsx"></demo>
In the code, the `mergeCells` function is defined to use the `rowspan` field in a row as the merge count.
```ts
function mergeCells({ row, col }: { row: any, col: StkTableColumn<any> }) {
    if (!row.rowspan) return;
    return { rowspan: row.rowspan[col.dataIndex] || 1 };
}
```
This allows you to directly define merge counts in the data without additional judgment in the `mergeCells` function.
```ts
{
    id: '1-1-1', continent: 'Asia', country: 'China', province: 'Beijing',
    rowspan: { continent: 12, country: 6, }
}
```
::: tip Performance
In virtual list mode, all merged cells (mergeCells function) will be traversed, which may have a certain impact on performance.
:::
::: warning Note
If the rowspan is very large (e.g. 1000 rows), the merged cell will still render all the rows it covers. Therefore, rowspan is not recommended to be very large.

## Row and Column Merging <Badge type="tip" text="^1.1.0" />
Row merging (`rowspan`) and column merging (`colspan`) can be used together, and are compatible with `virtual` and `virtual-x` virtual scrolling.

## Realtime Merge Cells
If you need to dynamically merge/split cells through user interaction (area selection + context menu), refer to [Realtime Merge Cells](/en/demos/realtime-merge-cells).
